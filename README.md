## **🏠 Welcome to Homio**

Homio is a clean, minimal, mobile-friendly and fully YAML-based dashboard for Home Assistant. It's still work in progress but wanted to share it with you after receiving many requests for it. It’s built with desktop/tablet/mobile thanks to its responsive layout. Everything is done in YAML to give you full control and make it easier to share, reuse, and tweak. I recommend to use the visual studio code editor plugin in home assistant to make coding that little bit easier.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

Please make sure to make a full backup of your current home assistant state, its just best practice. Before jumping in, make sure you’ve got the basics covered:

1. Home Assistant in storage Mode
Even though Homio is written entirely in YAML, you should leave the Lovelace mode set to storage in configuration.yaml. This allows you to keep using the UI editor for other dashboards, while loading Homio as a YAML dashboard.

```text
lovelace:
  mode: storage
  dashboards:
    dashboard-homio:
      mode: yaml
      title: "homio"
      icon: mdi:star-plus-outline
      show_in_sidebar: true
      filename: dashboards/homio/homio.yaml
```

2. Homio uses a couple of custom cards,

**button-card by Romraider** — https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card  - This is the main building block of Homio. Install it via HCS.

**layout-card by Thomas Loven** — https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card - You’ll need to actually use the slightly modified version included in this repo based on the layout-card by Thomas Loven              **https://github.com/iamtherufus/Homio/blob/main/layout-card-modified.js** which supports some extra CSS properties. Dont install this card via HACS, grab it from the repo and install it manually. If you have installed the un-modified version of this card via HACS in the past you will need to remove it otherwise it will conflict with the modified version from this repo.

The layout-card-modified needs to be installed in this location,

**/www/community/layout-card-modified/layout-card-modified.js**

**my-slider-v2 by AnthonMS** - This is a fantastic light slider created by AnthonMS which is used for the homio_light card brightness slider. Full details on his configuration can be found here.
     **https://github.com/AnthonMS/my-cards/blob/main/docs/cards/slider-v2.md**

The my-slider-V2 card needs to be installed in this location,

**/local/community/light-slider/my-slider-v2.js**

If you install either the layout-card-modified or my-slider-v2 to a different location that is ok but you must reference the location in the main home assistant configuration file **/config/configuation.yaml** under resources,

**Example**
```
  resources:
    - type: "module"
      url: "/hacsfiles/button-card/button-card.js?hacstag=146194325600"
    - type: "module"
      url: "/hacsfiles/kiosk-mode/kiosk-mode.js"
    - type: "module"
      url: "/local/community/layout-card-modified/layout-card-modified.js?v=12" **IMPORTANT**
    - type: "module"
      url: "/local/community/light-slider/my-slider-v2.js" **IMPORTANT**
    - type: "css"
      url: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Hanken+Grotesk:wght@100..900&display=swap"
```

**UPDATE WARNING**

Because we are putting lovelace into 'Storage' mode to protect previously created GUI dashboards,

```
lovelace:
  mode: storage
```

Home Assistant will still look in the manage resources location found in the GUI interface for any custom cards installed. If storage mode was set to YAML, this would not be an issue.

```
lovelace:
  mode: yaml
```

Make sure the cards mentioned above ARE all included under manage resources as well. This can be found in the top right hand corner of a GUI created dashboard by clicking the edit pencil then the 3 little dots then manage resources.

## Theme file

Make sure you load the homio theme file rather than the default HA one or one you were previously using. This will ensure you see all the correct fonts and colors. To do this navigate to your profile settings (click your user icon, usually in the bottom left) and select the homio theme from the dropdown menu.


## 📁 Folder Structure

Everything lives under `/config` in your Home Assistant setup,

## **🖼️ Assets Setup – Images & Icons**

To make Homio look the way it’s intended, you’ll need to add your own room images and icons to the www folder in Home Assistant. These are used for things like room backgrounds and custom icons inside button cards. I dont use the built in mdi icons as i dont like them, they are to bold for my liking. There are other HACS addons that you can use but i dont. I do use the google material icons though but download them from google at the 100 weight as i feel they fitted my design better. I will include these in the repo and i plan to keep adding to them as well.

Material design icons link can be found below, 

**https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.query=light**

📁 Folder Structure
Inside your /config/www directory, create the following folders:

```
www/
└── images/
    └── Homio/
        ├── rooms/       ← Background images for rooms
        └── icons/       ← SVG icons used in entity cards

```

🖼️ Room Backgrounds
Place your .jpg files in,

**Example**
```
/config/www/images/Homio/rooms/
```

Make sure the file names match what you use in the image variable in the homio_room template (without the file extension). 

**Example**:

```
- type: 'custom:button-card'
  variables:
    image: lounge # Will load lounge.jpg from the directory www/images/homio/room
    image_position: center center
    show_humid: true
    humid_sensor: sensor.living_room_sensor_humidity
    show_temp: true
    temp_sensor: sensor.living_room_sensor_temperature
    show_motion: true
    motion_sensor: binary_sensor.hue_motion_sensor_living_room
```

🧩 Icons
Put your .svg icon files here,

**Example**
```
/config/www/images/Homio/icons/
```

These are used for visual cues like heating, doors, or lights. You can reference them with:

```
- type: 'custom:button-card'
  variables:
    icon: lamp # Will load lamp.svg from the directory www/images/homio/icons
  template:
    - homio_light
  entity: light.hue_living_room_lamp 
  name: Lamp
```

## 🧱**Layout Cards**

Homio uses a consistent layout across all dashboards powered by custom:layout-card (modified version required – see Setup Requirements). The layout file handles page sizing, grid setup, and responsive breakpoints. The layout are 'yaml include' files so you wont actually need to edit most of these files. You will just have to reference them in one line of code which is much nicer than having to type out the full yaml code for it every single time. 

The files are found in the following directory,
**/config/dashboards/templates/includes**

### **homio_screen_layout**
Here’s what’s inside the main screen layout file. This is used for each room dasboard you create,

**Example**
```
  grid-template-columns: 1fr
  grid-column-gap: 0px
  margin: 0
  height: 100vh
  position: relative
```

This layout ensures a single-column responsive grid and full-height display.

**Example**

Use the layout in your dashboard YAML like this:

```
- type: custom:grid-layout
  title: lounge
  path: lounge
  layout: !include /config/dashboards/templates/includes/layouts/homio_screen_layout.yaml # This is the include line for the layout
  cards:
    - type: custom:button-card
      template:
        - homio_room
      name: Lounge
      variables:
        image: lounge
        temperature: sensor.lounge_temperature
        humidity: sensor.lounge_humidity
        show_temp: true
        show_humid: true
```

### **homio_entity_layout**

The homio_enitiy_layout is designed to make placing entity cards in a consistent, responsive layout easy. It handles spacing, responsive column counts, and layout switching for mobile views.

You don’t need to touch this file — just include it where you want a grid of homio_entity cards (or other custom buttons) to appear.

**Example**

```
position: absolute
grid-auto-columns: 260px
grid-auto-flow: column
grid-column-gap: 5px
margin: 0 0 0 8vw
padding: 0
inset: auto 0 85px 0
scroll-snap-type: x mandatory
overflow-y: hidden
mediaquery:
  # FOR VERTICAL MOBILE SCROLLING UNCOMMENT ALL LINES
  # "(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1249px)":
  #   position: relative
  #   grid-auto-flow: row
  #   grid-auto-columns: none
  #   grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr
  #   grid-column-gap: 5px
  #   grid-row-gap: 5px
  #   margin: 599px 4vw 0 4vw
  #   inset: auto
  # "(max-width: 768px)":
  #   position: relative
  #   grid-auto-flow: row
  #   grid-auto-columns: none
  #   grid-template-columns: 1fr
  #   grid-column-gap: 0
  #   grid-row-gap: 5px
  #   margin: 599px 4vw 0 4vw
  #   inset: auto
```

The key features of this are,

- Horizontal scroll layout on large screens

- Responsive grid (2 columns) on tablets

- Stacked layout (1 column) on mobile

- Scroll snap and animation-friendly for horizontal scrolling


**Example**

```
- type: custom:layout-card
  layout_type: custom:grid-layout
  layout: !include /config/dashboards/templates/includes/homio_entity_layout.yaml # This is the include line for the layout
  cards:
    - type: custom:button-card
      template: homio_entity
      entity: binary_sensor.front_door
      name: Front Door
      variables:
        icon: door
    - type: custom:button-card
      template: homio_entity
      entity: binary_sensor.windows
      name: Windows
      variables:
        icon: window
    - type: custom:button-card
      template: homio_entity
      entity: binary_sensor.motion
      name: Motion
      variables:
        icon: motion
```

          cards: !include ../includes/homio_navigation_list.yaml
        - type: custom:button-card
          template: homio_time
```

### **homio_navigation_list**

This file contains the individual navigation buttons used in the top and side navigation bars. Each button links to a different Homio room/dashboard screen. You will need to edit this file to display the named links you require in your navigation. Keep it to 9 or fewer links for the best layout on larger screens. You only need to change the label for the name of the link and the path link to point it to the correct dashboard for a particular room.

**Example**

```
- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room1
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room1

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room2
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room2

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room3
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room3

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room4
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room4

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room5
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room5

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room6
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room6

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room7
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room7

- type: custom:button-card
  template:
    - homio_nav_button
  label: room8
  variables:
    path: /dashboard-homio/room8

```

## **Button cards**

These are split into two catergories, base and cards. Both of these dont really need to be touched, they just hold all the styles for the relvant cards. The base directory cards are for generic cards such as time etc and the cards directory is for enitiy cards.

### **homio_default**

This is the foundational button card template used across most components. It sets consistent styles like font, layout and the fade in background effects when going between dashboards.

**Example**
```
homio_default:
  styles:
    card:
      - "--mdc-ripple-color": transparent
      - "-webkit-tap-highlight-color": transparent
      - position: relative
      - border: none
      - border-radius: 0
      - padding: 0
      - margin: 0
      - animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-in forwards
  extra_styles: |
    @keyframes fadeIn {
      from {
        opacity: 0
      }
      to {
        opacity: 1
      }
    }

```

### **homio_entity**

This template extends homio_default and is used for entity status cards such as lights, climate status, water, motion, doors, windows, etc. It’s clean, responsive, and visually consistent across different types of entities.

**Example**
```
homio_entity:
  template:
    - homio_default
  show_entity_picture: true
  entity_picture: |
    [[[
      return `/local/images/Homio/icons/${variables.icon}.svg`;
    ]]]
  styles:
    card:
      - height: 85px
      - scroll-snap-align: start
    img_cell:
      - justify-self: end
      - align-self: center
    icon:
      - width: 22px
      - height: 22px
```

### **homio_logo**

This is a small code to style the logo in the navigation bar,

**Example**
```
homio_logo:
  template:
    - homio_default
  tap_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: /dashboard-homio/home
  name: Homio.
  styles:
    name:
      - color: var(--primary-text-color)
      - letter-spacing: 2px
      - font-size: 18px
      - font-weight: 700
      - text-transform: uppercase
      - justify-self: start
    card:
      - background: transparent
      - pointer-events: all
```
### **homio_menu_icon**

This is the burger menu that will appear on screen sizes less than 1249px wide. This toggles the helper homio_mobile_navigation which will show and hide the navigation.

**Example**
```
homio_menu_icon:
  show_entity_picture: true
  entity_picture: |
    [[[
      if (states["input_boolean.homio_mobile_navigation"].state === "on") {
        return "/local/images/Homio/icons/close.svg";
      } else {
        return "/local/images/Homio/icons/menu.svg";
      }
    ]]]
  tap_action:
    action: call-service
    service: input_boolean.toggle
    service_data:
      entity_id: input_boolean.homio_mobile_navigation
  styles:
    card:
      - background: transparent
      - display: none
      - pointer-events: all
      - cursor: pointer
    img_cell:
      - width: 25px
    icon:
      - width: 100%
      - height: 100%
  extra_styles: |
    @media (max-width: 1249px) {
      .button-card-main {
          display: block !important;
        }
      }
```


### **homio_nav_button**

This is what will navigate your navigation links to the path you specified in the homio_navigation_links include file.

**Example**
```
homio_nav_button:
  template:
    - homio_default
  tap_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: "[[[ return variables.path ]]]"
  styles:
    name:
      - color: var(--primary-text-color)
      - font-size: 16px
      - font-weight: 700
      - border-bottom: >
          [[[ if(variables.path === window.location.pathname) {return "2px solid
          white"} else {return "none"} ]]]
      - justify-self: start
    card:
      - background: transparent
      - pointer-events: all
```

### **homio_time**

This sits in the main navigation and just pulls the current time for the sensor created in the sensors.yaml file in the root of the /config folder

**Example**
```
homio_time:
  template:
    - homio_default
  name: |
    [[[ 
        return states["sensor.current_time"].state
    ]]]
  styles:
    name:
      - color: var(--primary-text-color)
      - letter-spacing: 1px
      - font-size: 16px
      - text-transform: uppercase
      - font-weight: 700
      - justify-self: start
    card:
      - background: transparent
```

## **Entity Cards**

These are currently the cards I have setup,
- Room card
- Light card
- Thermostat card
  
There are more to come in the future that i am currently building.

### **homio_room**

<img width="1482" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-12 at 11 16 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a7dacf-6e47-4f03-96c4-c9cee3ec2bc9" />


The homio room card acts as the top visual banner for each room or area on your dashboard. It typically includes a large background image, room name, temperature/humidity readouts, and optional motion detection feedback.

This card is intended to be used once per room dashboard, placed at the top for an immersive overview.

The homio_light template extends homio_entity to provide dynamic control and status display for light entities. It includes a built-in brightness percentage readout and an animated slider (using my-slider-v2) for seamless brightness adjustment.

Make sure to use the template named homio_light for the custom button card,

**Key Features**

Shows brightness percentage when light is on.

Tap toggles light on only (off handled via hold or turning the brightness down to 0).

Hold toggles light off.

Animated brightness slider appears only when light is on.

**Example**
```
- type: custom:button-card
  template: homio_light
  entity: light.kitchen_ceiling
  name: Kitchen
  variables:
    icon: ceiling
```
my-slider-v2 must be installed via HACS or manually, and the resource must be included in your Lovelace configuration.

The homio thermostat template brings smart control to your cooling setup. It combines HVAC mode switching, target temperature setting, and a clean display layout using only button-card and layout-card components.

Make sure to use the template named homio_thermostat for the custom button card,

**Required Helpers & Setup**

The below two helper files are included in the packages folder in the repo that sit at the root level of the /config folder.

input_boolean.homio_heating_control: Controls visibility of the temp controls when the entity is tapped.

input_number.homio_thermostat_target_temperature: Stores the temperature to be sent in a helper which reacts much quicker on tap and only fires one service call to update the actual entity target temperature once the set button is triggered when you have the desired temperature set.

**Example**

```
- type: custom:button-card
  template: homio_thermostat
  entity: climate.living_room_thermostat
  name: Heating
```
